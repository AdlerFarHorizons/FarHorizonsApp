What I have learned:

Tiles:

	I can get tiles of nice looking maps using http://tile.openstreetmap.org/z/x/y.png. I have written a program ("downloader") that automatically downloads the tiles for the region of interest as a function of zoom level

	each tile is 256x256 and about 10-20KB in size as a png

	z=15 gives fairly nice  resolution on the streets (with local street names).

	It looks like we would need about 65,000 tiles (in zoom level 15) this is about 1-1.5 gigabytes of tile data that needs to be downloaded. At 50Mbytes a day this is 20-30 days.



Serving the tiles:

tilecache-2.11 is apparently a tileserver/cacher and will send requests to have tiles rendered if they do not yet exist.

with python Paste it can serve as a stand-alone tileserver.


Slippy Maps:

The industry standard seems to be OpenLayers. 
So how do we get everyone to talk to everyone else?
