Replacement APRS symbols for UI-View     

Revision "H"   28 Sept 2005

Unpack this archive into the main UI-View directory.  
The original symbol files SYMBOLS.BMP and SYMBOLS2.BMP 
will not be overwritten.  UI-View automatically uses an 
alternate set if they are named (like the ones in this zipfile) 
MYSYMB.BMP and MYSYMB2.BMP. 

Note 1:   If installed while the UI-View program is running,
the new symbols will not appear until UI-View is exited 
and restarted. 

Note 2:   A GIF image, Rev H Symbol Chart.GIF , that shows the 
relationship between the ASCII text symbol codes and the icons 
they represent is also in the archive. This image is for quick 
reference, and is in no way required by the program. 


The symbols in this set are a composite of the original 
G4IDE set provided with UI-View and the U.S. customary
symbols, designed by KH4G used by WinAPRS, APRSplus, Findu 
and APRSworld, including the latest suggested changes by 
WB4APR. New symbols for "SUV" and "Rocket" have been added to
this set, along with many restyled (all vehicles now point 
to the right) and enhanced symbols.

The symbols are smaller (16x6 pixels rather than the 
20x20 pixel size used by the original G4IDE ones, and
more brightly colored.  

====== BACKGROUND ======

The original "factory" symbols are stored in two files, "symbols.bmp"
and "symbols2.bmp" , accompanied by the file "symbols.txt" that creates
the text labels/descriptions of these symbols that you see in the
Station Setup and Station Lists.

If you want to change the symbol set, you can do so without loosing the
ability to revert to the originals.  If you create/modify a symbol set,
name/rename them "mysyb.bmp" and "mysymb2.bmp, and place them in the
main UIview directory, UIview will AUTOMATICALLY use these on the next
boot instead of the originals which remain untouched.

These new files need to be accompanied by a new text file "mysymb.txt"
in order to present the correct text labels for the new set.  Typically
"mysymb.txt" is created by editing a copy of the original "symbols.txt"
in a basic ASCII text editor like Notepad and resaving it to the new name.

A version of the file "mysymb.txt" (that matches the new symbol set) is
in my zip archive and will be copied into the UIview directory along
with the new image files when the zip file is unpacked.    Note that
none of the "mysymb.xxx" files will exist in a "stock" version of UIview
-- you have to add them.
